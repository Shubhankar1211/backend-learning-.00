// summuary of 9.1 react
// For static website we dont need react
// do not incerese the bundel size 
//react is just an easier way to write normal html/css and js, it's a new syntax that under the hood gets converted to html/css/js
//just how chatgpt is na esier way to write code , React is an easier way to write html and css
//  why react
/*
people realised it's harder to do DOM  manipulation the conventional way
ther weere librarires that come into pictures thet made it slightly easy , but still  for a very  big app it's  very hard(jquery) unde rthe hood the react complier convert your code  to html/css/js


// some react jargon 
to create a react app we ussually to worry about the two things state and components
creators of fronted frameworks realiesd that all websites can effectively be divided into two parts for dynamic part

an object that represents the correct state of the app 
it represents the dynamic things in your app(things that changes)
for example , the value of the counter

how a DOM element should render , given a state 
it is a re-usable dynamic html snippet that changes given the state 


a state chenge trigger a re-render 
a re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulte when the state changes

simple react is
you usually to define all your componts once then you have to do is update the state of your app, react takes care of re-rendering your app

if interview ask what is jsx it is html say it technically it is not html is is  xml
 jsx menas javascript xml
 // jsx stands for js xml . it is a syntax extension for js ,
 //  most commonly used with react ,a popular js lib for building user interfase , 
 // jsx allows you to erite html like code directly within js .
 // this makes it easier to create and manage the user interface in react applications
